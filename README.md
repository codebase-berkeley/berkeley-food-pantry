# Berkeley Food Pantry: Stock Listing and Appointment website
- Spring 2022 Mentored Project
- Codebase will be building a standalone web-app for the Berkeley Food Pantry to aid in the efficiency and ease in the pantryâ€™s food distribution system. This will be achieved by having a stock listing accessible to the users, having a system to make an appointment to avoid clutter in person, and a feature to record dietary preferences so the pantry can make these accommodations beforehand.
